  The <a target="newpage" href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips197/fips-197.pdf">Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)</a> is one of the most popular block
  encryption algorithms used throughout the world today. Also known as
  Rijndael, AES was developed by Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen.
  </p>

  <p>
  I created the <i>AES Funtastic</i> application as a project for a graduate studies
  course in Computer Security (SEIS 720), taught by Dr. Brad Rubin at the
  <a target="newpage" href="http://www.stthomas.edu/">University of St. Thomas</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  The purpose of this project was to enhance my understanding of the AES algorithm and
  to provide a platform that other students could use to exercise the algorithm. The algorithm
  design was heavily influenced by the paper, <a target="newpage" href="http://www.adamberent.com/documents/AESbyExample.htm"><i>Advanced Encryption Standard by Example</i></a>,
  written by Adam Berent.
  </p>

  <p>
  I wrote the application in Javascript since it's my language <i>du jour</i> and it's
  widely supported in every modern web browser. The application interface was developed
  in the <a target="newpage" href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> and <a target="newpage" href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> frameworks.
  </p>

  <p>
  As a learning tool, the application is fairly limited in functionality. While key sizes from
  128-to-256 bit are fully supported, only a single 16-byte block can be encrypted/decrypted at
  a time. In other words, you can't use this implementation of the algorithm to encrypt an
  entire document.
  </p>

  <p>
  The application does not represent a reference implementation. While I attempted to follow
  best practices in code design, I valued readability over brevity and performance. The
  code implementation makes use of several algorithmic shortcuts by leveraging pre-calculated tables
  instead of performing raw computations. This design decision may be advantageous in cases where memory
  is not a constraint.
  </p>

  <p>
  I implemented proper unit testing wherever possible to validate the AES algorithm functions.
  It's important to note that the testing isn't exhaustive, and the algorithm could potentially
  contain some defects. Do not use this algorithm implementation in production without further testing.
